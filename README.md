## About The Project

Several natural risks including fire, tsunami, flood, earthquake, etc., are hurting persons, buildings, animals, and other infrastructures. These dangers can not be halted but can be averted utilising numerous approaches as remote sensign, LiDAR, and seismic stations. One of the purposes of earthquake hazard analysis is to reduce the effect of earthquakes on civilization by limiting damage to buildings and infrastructure. Predicting seismic occurrences using continuous data and applying it in real-time to early warning systems or evaluating it offline to hunt for previously unpredicted earthquakes is an essential problem.

So we have developed a data model to predict the areas with the highest risk of being affected by an earthquake using ensemble learning with the Random Forest and a general Neural Network algorithms.
